# Maelstrom-based workflow

- Always start with a plan. If an external plan hasn't been referenced, redirect the user to start
  in plan mode
- After completing the work getting all the tests passing, commit it to git (git add / git commit) &
  create a PR for it (mael gh create-pr)

(maelstrom instructions end)
